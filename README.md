Archived version - Practical example of how not to do stuff!

Check it out @ [https://something.5apps.com](https://something.5apps.com).
Go ahead and play with the forms (login: **admin**, password: **doesn't matter - I mean it - This is not the password!**).
There used to be a database hooked up to this. If you go over the PHP code you'll see how bad the design was.

*OK FINE! Burn me!* I was very young and very stupid - I wrote all the code in **notepad**...

You can go ahead and look at the [new design](http://jana-deutsch.com). 
It's bare bones because I didn't feel like porting all the functionality. Maybe some day.

Several things that I've learned doing this project:
- Check you're spelling :P
- Use a framework or a better library than jQuery when creating a more complex app. The base file is 3000 lines of spaghety mess
- Animations are not everything - but they look efing amazing!
- Don't use PHP
- Ok maybe you can/should - but I certainly wont
- Keep all your old code! You can learn a lot from your mistakes and they are a nice reminder of how far you've come ;)

## Anyways have fun! :)
